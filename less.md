### 🔍 Breaking it down

#### 🏗️ `__init__` Method

This is a *special* function called every time a new Hero is created.
It sets up the hero’s starting information (name, money, items).

* `self.name` — hero’s name
* `self.money` — how much money the hero has
* `self.inventory` — what items they carry

#### 🧍‍♀️ Creating a Hero

```python
Jillian = Hero("Jillian", 150, ["Potion"])
```

* We just made a new **Hero object** named Jillian!
* Jillian starts with **$150** and one **Potion**.

#### 💰 Buying an Item

```python
Jillian.buy({"title": "Sword", "atk": 34})
print(Jillian.__dict__)
```

When Jillian buys something:

* The item is added to her inventory list.
* The inventory is printed.
* `__dict__` shows all her data stored in a dictionary format.

## 🔒 4. Encapsulation: Protecting Data

Encapsulation means **keeping related data and methods inside a single unit (the class)** — and **controlling how outside code interacts** with that data.

### Analogy:

> Imagine the Hero’s backpack is zipped shut 🎒.
> Only the Hero knows how to open it properly (using their methods).
> You don’t just reach in and mess with it directly!

In Python, we can use **naming conventions** to mark variables as “private” (for internal use only).

Example:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance):
        self.owner = owner
        self.__balance = balance  # double underscore means "private"

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def show_balance(self):
        print(f"{self.owner} has ${self.__balance}")
```

This way, no one outside the class should directly do `my_account.__balance = 0`.
They should use the **methods** (`deposit`, `show_balance`) instead.

## 🧠 5. Practice Time

### ✏️ Activity 1 – Create Your Own Hero

Make your own hero object with a name, starting money, and one item.

Then, use `.buy()` to add another item to your inventory.

### ✏️ Activity 2 – Add Encapsulation

Create a class `Pet` that has:

* A **name**
* A **private variable** for happiness level (e.g., `__happiness`)
* A method to **play()** that increases happiness
* A method to **show_status()** that prints how happy the pet is

Example output:

```
Fluffy is playing fetch!
Fluffy’s happiness is now 10
```

## 💬 6. Key Takeaways

| Concept           | Meaning                                       | Example                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Class**         | Blueprint for creating objects                | `class Hero:`                        |
| **Object**        | A specific example from a class               | `Jillian = Hero(...)`                |
| **Method**        | Function inside a class                       | `def buy(self, item)`                |
| **Encapsulation** | Keeping data + methods together and protected | private variables like `__balance`   |
| **self**          | Refers to the *current object*                | `self.name` means “this hero’s name” |

## 🌟 7. Challenge (Optional)

Modify the Hero class so that:

* It has a **private money variable** (`__money`)
* You must use a method like `.spend(amount)` to reduce money when buying something

Then print out how much money Jillian has left after buying her sword.
